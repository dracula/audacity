#### Install manually

Download the [`ImageCache.png`](https://github.com/dracula/audacity/blob/main/ImageCache.png).

#### Activating theme
1. Go to the Audacity folder in:
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Audacity\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/audacity/`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/audacity/`
2. In there, create a folder and name it `Theme`
3. Inside the `Theme` folder, create another folder and name it `custom`
4. Place the downloaded `ImageCache.png` inside the `custom` folder
5. In Audacity, go to `Edit > Preferences > Interface > Theme` and set it to `custom`
6. Boom! It's Dracula Themed! ðŸ’œ

> Do not rename the `ImageCache.png` because audacity won't pick up on it.
